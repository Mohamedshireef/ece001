    <td>The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected with one another to communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data.</td>
    <td>A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network often denote an individual; a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the technology to cater to the individual needs and also to obtain contextual information of each node.</td></tr></table>
